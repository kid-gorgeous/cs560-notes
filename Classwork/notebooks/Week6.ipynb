    "#### Heap (Data Structure):\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap is a specialized *tree*-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satifies the **heap property**: in a *max heap*, for any given child node, if the child node has a parent, then the *key* (the *value*) of parent is greater than or equal to the key of child. In a *min heap*, the key of the parent is less than or equal to the key of the child. The node at the *top* of the heap is called the root node. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note* - the heap is an efficient implementation of an abstract data type, called a priority queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "The (*binary*) *heap* data structure is an data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree. Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Heapsort Algorithm: \n",
    " **Basic** \n",
    "- *find-max* (find-min): find a maximum item of a max-heap, or a minimum item of a min-heap (a.k.a *peak*)\n",
    "- *insert*: adding a new key to the heap (aka *push*)\n",
    "- *extract-max* (or *extract-min*): returns the node of maximem value from a max heap [or minimum value from a min heap] after removing if from the heap (aka *pop*)\n",
    "- *delete-max* (or *delete-min*): removing the root node of a max heap (or min heap), respectfully.\n",
    "- *replace*: pop root and push a new key. More efficent than pop followed by push, since only need to balance once, not twice, and appropriate for fixed-size heaps/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creation**\n",
    "- *create-heap*: create an empty heap\n",
    "- *heapify*: create a heap out of given array of elements (special helper function), \n",
    "- *merge* (*union*): joining two heaps to form a valid new heap containing all the elements of both, preserving the original heaps.\n",
    "- *meld*: joining two heaps to form a valid new heap containing all the elements of both, destroying the original heaps. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inspection**\n",
    "- *size*: return the number of items in the heap.\n",
    "- *is-empty*: return true if the heap is empty, false otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal**\n",
    "- *increase-key* or *decrease-key*: updating a key withing a max- or min- heap\n",
    "- *delete*: delete an arbitrary node (followed by moving last node and sifting to maintain heap)\n",
    "- *sift-up*: move a node up in the tree, as long as needed; used to restore heap condition after insertion. Called *sift* becasuse node moves up the tree until it reaches the correct level.\n",
    "- *sift-down*: move a node down in the tree, similar to sift-up; used to retore heap condition after deletion or replacement.\n",
