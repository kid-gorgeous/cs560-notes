    "#### Heap (Data Structure):\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap is a specialized *tree*-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satifies the **heap property**: in a *max heap*, for any given child node, if the child node has a parent, then the *key* (the *value*) of parent is greater than or equal to the key of child. In a *min heap*, the key of the parent is less than or equal to the key of the child. The node at the *top* of the heap is called the root node. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note* - the heap is an efficient implementation of an abstract data type, called a priority queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "The (*binary*) *heap* data structure is an data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree. Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is completely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the left up to a point. An array *A* that represents a heap is an object with two attributes: *A.length*, which (as usual) gives the number of elements in the array, and *A.heap-size*, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored withing array *A*. That is, although *A*[1 . . *A.length*] may contain numbers, only the elements in *A*[1 .. *A.heap-size*], where $0 \\leq A.heap-size \\leq A.length$, are valid elements of the heap. The root of the tree is *A*[1], and given the index *i* of a node, it can easily compute the indices of its parent, left child, and right child:\n",

    "**Parent(*i*)**</br>\n",
    "1  **return** $\\lfloor *i*/2 \\rfloor$ \n",
    "\n",
    "**Left(*i*)**</br>\n",
    "1  **return** 2*i*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right(*i*)**</br>\n",
    "1  **return** 2*i* + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "On most computers, the LEFT procedure can compute 2*i* in one instruction by simply shifting the binary representation of *i* left by one bit position. Similarly, the RIGHT procedure can quickly compute $2i + 1$ by shifting the binary representation of *i* left by one bit position and then adding in a 1 as the low-order bit. The PARENT procedure can compute $\\lfloor i/2 \\rfloor$ by shifting *i* right one bit position. Good implementations of heapsort often implement these procedures as \"macros\" or \"inline\" procedures. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are two kinds of binary heaps: max-heaps and min-heaps. In both kinds, the values in the nodes satifya ***heap property***, the specifies of which depend on the kind of heap. In a ***max-heap***, the ***max-heap property*** is that for every node *i* other than the root,\n",
    "\n",
    "$A[PARENT(i)] \\geq A[i]$\n",
    "\n",
    "that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent. Thus, the largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains values no larger than that contained at the node itself. A ***min-heap*** is organized in the oppisite way; the ***min-heap property*** is that for every node *i* other than the root, \n",
    "\n",
    "$A[PARENT(*i*) \\leq A[i]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest element in a min-heap is at the root. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the *heapsort* algorithm, we use *max-heaps*. Min-heaps commonly implement priority queues, which was dicuessed in Section 6.5. It shall be precise in specifiying whether to use max-heap or a min-heap for any particular application, and when properties apply to either max-heaps or min-heaps, just use ***heap***. \n",
    "\n",
    "Viewing a heap as a tree, it define the ***height*** of a node in a heap to be number of edges on the longest simple downward path from the node to a leaf, and it is defined the height of its root. Since a heap of *n* elements is based on a complete binary tree, its height is $\\Theta(lg(n))$. It can be seen that the basic operations on heaps run in time at most proportional to the height of the tree and thus take *O*(lg(*n*)) time. The remainder of this chapter presents some basic procedures and shows how they are used in a sorting algorithm and a priority-queue data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The MAX-HEAPIFY procedure, which runs in *O*(lg(*n*)) time, is the key to maintaining the max-heap property.\n",
    "- The BUILD-MAX-HEAP procedure, which runs in linear time, produces a max-heap from an unordered input array.\n",
    "- The HEAPSORT procedure, which runs in *O*(*n*lg(*N)\n",
