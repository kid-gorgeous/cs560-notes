    "Consequently, a maximum subarray of *A*[*low* .. *high*] must lie in exactly one of these places. In fact, a maximum subarray of *A*[*low* .. *high*] must have the greatest sum over all subarrays entirely in *A*[*mid* + 1 .. *high*], or crossing the midpoint. The maximum subarray can be found in *A*[*low* .. *mid*] and *A*[*mid* + 1 .. *high*] recursively, because these two subproblems are smaller instances of the problem of finding a maximum subarray. Thus, all that is left to do is find a maximum subarray that crosses the midpoint, and take a subarray with the largest sum of the three.\n",

    "The crossing at the midpoint can easily be found in linear time based on the size of the subarray *A*[*low* .. *high*]. The problem is *not* a smaller instance of our original problem, because it has the added restriction that the subarray it chooses must cross the midpoint. Any subarray crossing the midpoint is itself made of two subarray *A*[*i* .. *mid**] and *A*[*mid* + 1 .. *j*] and then combine them. THe procedure FIND-MAX-CROSSING-SUBARRAY takes as input the array *A* and the indices *low*, *mid*, and *high*, and it returns a tuple containing the indices demarcating a maximum subarray that crosses the midpoint, along with the sum of the values in a maximum subarray. \n",

    "The procedure works as follows. Lines 1-7 find a maximum subarray of the left half, *A*[*low* .. *mid*]. Since the subarray must contain *A*[*mid*], the **for** loop of lines 3-7 starts the index *i* at *mid* and works down to *low*, so that every subarray it considers is of the form *A*[*i* .. *mid**]. Whenever a subarray *A*[*i* .. *mid*] with a sum of values greater than *left-sum*, the *left-sum* is updated to this subarray's sum in line 6, and in line 7 update the variable *max-left* to record this index *j* at *mid* + 1 and works up to *high*, so that every subarray it considers is of the form *A*[*mid* + 1 .. *j*].

Since each iteration of each of the two **for** loops takes $\\Theta(1)$ time, count up the interations there are altoghter. The **for** loop of lines 3-7 makes *mid* - *low* + 1 iterations, and the **for** loop of lines 10-14 meakes *high* - *mid* iterations, and so the total number of iterations is \n",

    "Similar to FIND-MAXIMUM-CROSSING-SUBARRAY, the recursive procedure FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY returns a tuple containing the indicies that demarcate a maximum subarray, along with the sum of the values in a maximum subarray. Line 1 tests for the base case, where the subarray has just one element. A subarray with one element has only one subarray. Line 2 returns a tuple with the starting and ending indeicies of just the one element, along with its value. Lines 3-11 handle the recursive case. Line 3 does the divide part, computing the index *mid* of the midpoint. Let's refer to the subarray *A*[*low* .. *mid*] as the ***left subarray*** and to *A*[*mid* + 1 .. *high*] as the ***right subarray***. Becuase the subarray *A*[*low* .. *high*] contains at least two elements, each of the left and right subarrays must have a least one lement. Lines 4 and 5 conquer by recursively finding maximum subarrays within the left and right aubarrays. Lines 6-11 form the combine part. Line 6 finds a maximum subarray that crosses the midpoint. (Recall that becuase line 6 solves a subproblem that is not a smaller instance of the original problem, consider it to be in the combine part.) Line 7 tests whether the left subarray contains a subarray with the maximum sum, and line 8 returns that maximum subarray. Otherwise, line 9 tests the left nor right subarrays contain a subarray achieving the maximum sum, then a maximum subarray must cross the midpoint, and line 11 returns it. \n",
